          <p>
            When Setsuna saw school idols for the first time, it felt like
            "fate" was calling out to her; the very reason for becoming a school
            idol herself. Seemingly always busy with school idol activities,
            Setsuna had become somewhat of an urban legend among the students at
            Nijigasaki, with many claiming they had never even seen her at
            school. Setsuna would always wear her idol outfit whenever she is
            with the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the girl that everyone knew as "Setsuna Yuki" had actually
            adopted that name herself, so that her parents would not figure out
            she was an idol. Setsuna comes from a strict household, where things
            like anime, manga, and school idols are banned. One reason why she
            became an urban legend is linked to the fact that she attends the
            same school as Nana Nakagawa, who has a different appearance than
            Setsuna.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with Karin Asaka and Kasumi Nakasu, she works with Dengeki
            Online. The name "Setsuna Yuki" came from the characters of a light
            novel that Nana read.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Background</h2>
          <p>
            Setsuna has an energetic smile and a distinctive style of
            performing. She's very friendly, charismatic and naturally people
            oriented. She is easily excitable and full of energy, and she can be
            moved emotionally very easily. She lights up whenever she is asked a
            question about her interests, which include anime, manga, video
            games, and school idols. While she is a very passionate geek and
            loves to talk about her otaku hobbies with her friends, due to her
            status as a serious and hard-working student council president, she
            feels she has to hide them from her mom. When the latter learns
            about Setsuna, she is happy with it and cheerfully goes to the
            concert.
          </p>
          <p>
            She takes her passions very seriously, and with regards to being a
            school idol, always wants to improve. She wants to share her love of
            school idols with the world, and help others feel more comfortable
            saying what they love, but she can be too passionate about idol
            activities, the reason that drove the members of the original School
            Idol Club apart and forcing her to disband the club afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Nana, she also strives to do well in school, so she always does
            homework as soon as possible and studies on her off days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setsuna is also very kind and helpful, and is shown to be very
            supportive of her friends. For example, in the Dengeki 4-koma, she
            continued to eat Kasumi's spicy bread in order to not let her down
            since she cooked it for her and Karin. She tries to encourage
            everyone to pursue their dreams and is open to helping others with
            their dancing and singing.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Clubs and Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            Despite not being good at it, Setsuna likes cooking, but when she
            asks how it tastes, she never gets an answer. Some of her friends
            say that her cooking's taste is "a bit too original".
          </p>
          <p>
            She likes everything involving school idols and is very
            knowledgeable about them. She likes every subject in school except
            health class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setsuna is very interested in anime, manga, and video games. She can
            get very excited and talk at length about anime concepts and her
            favorite series. During weekends, Setsuna might consume about five
            hours of anime throughout the day and spend about three hours
            playing video games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setsuna is the student council president of Nijigasaki High School
            as Nana Nakagawa, although she loses her position to Shioriko Mifune
            in chapter nine of the School Idol Festival ALL STARS story.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Appearance</h2>
          <p>
            Setsuna is rather short with a slim figure. She has long bluish dark
            gray hair that she partly ties into a ponytail on the right side
            with a rose-shaped ornament and light grey eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As <b>Nana Nakagawa</b>, she wears glasses and ties her hair into
            two low pigtail braids instead.
